[Intro]

G D G D

[Verse]

G                    D/F#
Step one you say we need to talk
    Em                 D/F#             G
He walks you say sit down it’s just a talk
             D/F#           Em
He smiles politely back at you
             D/F#              G
You stare politely right on through
               D/F#          Em
Some sort of window to your right
             D/F#              G
As he goes left and you stay right
              D/F#             Em
Between the lines of fear and blame
                   D/F#
And you begin to wonder why you came


[Chorus]

  C             D                Em
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            G             D/F#
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             G     D      G
Had I known how to save a life

[Bridge]
D/F#   Em   D/F#

[Verse]

G                 D/F#
Let him know that you know best
       Em           D/F#
Cause after all you do know best
G                  D/F#
  Try to slip past his defense
Em               D/F#
Without granting innocence
G             D/F#             Em
   Lay down a list of what is wrong
             D/F#
The things you’ve told him all along
G                   D/F#
And pray to God he hears you
    Em             D/F#
And pray to God he hears you


[Chorus]

  C             D                Em
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            G             D/F#
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             G     D      G
Had I known how to save a life

[Bridge]
D/F#   Em   D/F#

[Verse]

    G            D/F#
As he begins to raise his voice
     Em              D/F#                  G
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
                 D/F#
Drive until you lose the road
    Em                         D/F#
Or break with the ones you’ve followed
G             D/F#
   He will do one of two things
Em                D/F#
He will admit to everything
G                     D/F#
Or he’ll say he’s just not the same
     Em             D/F#
And you’ll begin to wonder why you came


[Chorus]

  C             D                Em
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            G             D/F#
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             G     D
Had I known how to save a life
  C             D                Em
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            G             D/F#
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             G     D      G
Had I known how to save a life
