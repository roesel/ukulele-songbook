Title: Hand in my Pocket
By: Alanis Morisette

[Verse]
G
I'm broke but I'm happy, I'm sore but I'm kind
G
I'm short but I'm healthy, yeah
G
I'm high but I'm grounded, I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed
G
I'm lost but I'm hopeful, baby

[Chorus]
                      F          C
And what it all comes down to
                              G
Is that everything's gonna be fine, fine, fine
            F
Cause I got one hand in my pocket
        C            C9               G
And the other one is givin' a high five


[Verse*]
I feel drunk but I'm sober, I'm young and I'm underpaid
I'm dyin' but I'm workin', yeah
I care but I'm restless, I'm here but I'm really gone
I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby


[Chorus]
                      F         C
And what it all comes down to
                              G
Is that ev'rything's gonna be quite alright
            F
Cause I got one hand in my pocket
        C            C9                G
And the other one is flickin' a cigarette

[Verse*]
(Instrumental part: play G (boring) or jump to the next chorus!)
(Or get Springsteen/Dylan/Alanis to play the harmonica ;).)

[Chorus]
                      F         C
And what it all comes down to
                                     G
Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet
            F
Cause I got one hand in my pocket
        C            C9               G
And the other one is givin' a peace sign


[Verse*]
I'm free but I'm focused, I'm green but I'm wise
I'm hard but I'm friendly, baby
I'm sad but I'm laughin', I'm brave but I'm chickenshit
I'm sick but I'm pretty, baby


[Chorus] 
                      F         C
And what it all boils down to
                                       G
Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet
           F
Well I got one hand in my pocket
        C            C9            G
And the other one is playin' a piano

[Chorus]
                      F                   C
And what it all comes down to, my friend, yeah
                           G
Is that everything is just fine, fine, fine
            F
Cause I got one hand in my pocket
        C            C9             G
And the other one is hailing a taxi cab
