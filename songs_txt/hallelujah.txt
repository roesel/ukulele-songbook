Title: Hallelujah
By: Leonard Cohen
Note: Original version (1985)

[Verse]
     C                 Am
I've heard there was a secret chord
     C                    Am
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
    F                G               C       G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
   C                   F           G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
    Am              F
The minor fall, the major lift
    G               Em          Am
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

[Chorus]
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F          C~G~C~C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse&]
Your faith was strong but you needed proof,
you saw her bathing on the roof,
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.
She tied you to a kitchen chair,
she broke your throne, and she cut your hair,
and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.

[Chorus&]
Hallelujah, ...

[Verse&]
You say I took the name in vain,
but I don't even know the name,
but if I did—well, really—what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word,
it doesn't matter which you heard,
the holy or the broken Hallelujah.

[Chorus&]
Hallelujah, ...

[Verse&]
I did my best, it wasn't much,
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch.
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you.
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
with nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah.

[Chorus&]
Hallelujah, ...
