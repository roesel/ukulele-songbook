[Intro]
G  Am  C   G     G  Am  C   G

[Verse]
G
Twenty-five years and my life is still
Am
Trying to get up that great big hill
   C               G
Of hope for a destination

G
I realized quickly when I knew I should
         Am
That the world was made of this brotherhood
   C                      G
Of man, for whatever that means


[Pre-Chorus]
         G                                    
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
        Am           
Just to get it all out, what's in my head  
      C                         G
and I - I am feeling a little peculiar

         G 
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
      Am
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and
  C                                           G
I scream at the top of my lungs "What's going on?"


[Chorus]
            G           Am
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"
        C                 G
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
            G           Am
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"
        C                 G
I said "Hey, what's going on?"


[Interlude]
G     Am  C   G
Ooh, Ooh Ooh      
G     Am  C   G
Ooh, Ooh Ooh 


[Verse]
      G                   Am
And I try, oh my God do I try
              C                  G
I try all the time, in this institution
      G                    Am
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
                    C
I pray every single day
          G
For a revolution


[Chorus*]           
And so I cry sometimes... x1
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey ... x2


[Interlude]
G     Am  C   G
Ooh, Ooh Ooh      


[Outro]
G
Twenty-five years and my life is still
Am                                      C
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
           G
For a destination
