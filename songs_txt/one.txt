[Intro*]
Am Dsus2 Fmaj7 G

[Verse]
Am                Dsus2
  Is it getting better
Fmaj7                G
  or do you feel the same?
Am                Dsus2
  Will it make it easier on you,
      Fmaj7               G
  now  you got someone to blame?

[Chorus]
          C          Am
  You say  one love,   one life,
Fmaj7                C
  when it's one need  in the night.
C           Am
  One love,   we got to share it,
Fmaj7                    C                  Am Dsus2 Fmaj7 G
  Leaves you baby if you  don't care for it

[Verse]
Am          Dsus2
  Did I disappoint you?
Fmaj7                          G
  Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
Am                       Dsus2
  You act like you never had love
Fmaj7                     G
  and you want me to go without.

[Chorus]
           C          Am
  Well, it's too late   tonight
Fmaj7                    C
  to drag the past out into the light.
C                      Am
  We're one, but we're   not the same.
            Fmaj7              C
  We got to  carry each other,  carry each other
     Am Dsus2 Fmaj7 G
  one.

[Verse]
Am                          Dsus2
  Have you come here for forgiveness?
Fmaj7                       G
  Have you come to raise the dead?
Am                           Dsus2
  Have you come here to play Jesus
Fmaj7                   G
  to the lepers in your head?

[Chorus]
C
  Did I ask too much,
Am
  more than a lot.
Fmaj7
  You gave me nothing,
           C
  now it's  all I got.
C                      Am
  We're one, but we're   not the same
          Fmaj7                     C
  Well we  hurt each other, then we do it again

[Bridge]
          C                  Am
  You say  love is a temple, love a higher law.
  C                 Am
  Love is a temple, love the higher law.
      C                    G
  You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl.
        G                Fmaj7
  And I can't be holding on
                   Fmaj7                C
  to what you got,  when all you got is hurt.

[Outro]
           Am
  One love,  one blood,
Fmaj7                  C
  one life, you got to do what you should.
C          Am
  One life   with each other:
Fmaj7     C
  sisters, brothers.
C                    Am
  One life, but we're  not the same.
            Fmaj7               C
  We got to  carry each other, carry each other,
       C Am   Fmaj7 C
  One,       One.

[Ending*]
C Am Fmaj7 C (4x)
