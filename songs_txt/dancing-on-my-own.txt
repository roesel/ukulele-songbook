Does she love you better than I can?

I just gotta see it for myself

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh..

I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooohh..

I keep dancing on my own

I'm all messed up, I'm so outta line

Stilettos and broken bottles,

I'm spinnin' around in circles

Fsus2   G                  Am              G                  Fsus2 (one strum each)
so far away but still so near (the lights go on, the music dies)

Am           G                       Fsus2                  Fsus2
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy your taking home, ooohh..
Am    G             Fsus2  Fsus2
I keep dancing on my own

[Chorus]
C          G                    Fsus2     Fsus2
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh no

I keep dancing on my own

but you don't see me standing here
