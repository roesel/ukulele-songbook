Title: Tears in heaven
By: Eric Clapton

[Verse]
D	          A	      Bm
  Would you know my name,
G      D        	   A
  If I saw you in heaven,
D          A      Bm
  Would it be the same,
G      D             A
  If I saw you in heaven,

[Chorus]
Bm	         Gb
   I must be strong,
Am           B
   and carry on,
	      Em	            A7
Cause I know I don't belong,
	         D
Here in heaven.

[Verse&]
Would you hold my hand,
If I saw you in heaven,
Would you help me stand,
If I saw you in heaven.

[Chorus]
Bm	           Gb   Am	              B
  I'll find my way, through night and day
        Em	              A7
Cause I know I just can't stay
	         D
Here in heaven

[Verse]
F          C  	     Dm
  Time can bring you down
	       G         C      G~Am~G~C
Time can bend your knee
F	         C		      Dm
  Time can break your heart

Have you begging please
	      A
Begging please

  Beyond the door,   there's peace I'm sure.
      Em	                A7
And I know there'll be no more...
            D
Tears in heaven


[Verse&]
Would you know my name,
If I saw you in heaven,
Would it be the same,
If I saw you in heaven.

Am          B
  and carry on,
	      Em	           A7
Cause I know I don't belong,

Here in heaven.
