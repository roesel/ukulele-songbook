[Verse]
     Am          C
Your beauty is beyond compare,
     G                Am
with flaming locks of auburn hair,
     G              Em              Am    Am
with ivory skin and eyes of emerald green.
     Am              C
Your smile is like a breath of spring,
     G                  Am
your voice is soft like summer rain
    G           Em               Am
and I cannot compete with you, Jolene.

[Chorus*]
Jolene, Jolene, ...

[Verse*]
He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene.

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene


[Chorus*]
Jolene, Jolene, ...

[Verse*]
You could have your choice of men,
but I could never love again, 'cause
he's the only one for me, Jolene.

I had to have this talk with you,
my happiness depends on you,
whatever you decide to do, Jolene

[Chorus*]
Jolene, Jolene, ...
