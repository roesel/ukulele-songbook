[Verse]

Em                G
All around me are familiar faces 
D                 A
Worn out places – worn out faces 
Em                          G
Bright and early for their daily races 
D               A
Going nowhere – going nowhere 
Em                      G
Their tears are filling up their glasses 
D             A
No expression – no expression 
Em                     G
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow 
D           A
No tomorrow – no tomorrow 


[Chorus]

Em                  A                      Em
And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad 
Em                      A                            Em
The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had 
Em                 A                           Em
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take 
Em                  A
When people run in circles it’s a very very 
   Em                     A
            Maaaaaad world 
   Em                       A
            Maaaaaaad world 


[Verse]

Em                        G
Children waiting for the day they feel good 
D               A
Happy birthday – happy birthday 
Em                        G
Made to feel the way that every child should 
D               A
 Sit and listen – sit and listen 
Em                       G
Went to school and I was very nervous 
D              A
No one knew me – no one knew me 
Em                     G
Hello teacher tell me what’s my lesson 
D                     A
Look right through me – look right through me 


[Chorus]

Em                  A                      Em
And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad 
Em                      A                             Em
The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had 
Em                A                            Em
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take 
Em                  A
When people run in circles it’s a very very 
   Em                     A
            Maaaaaad world 
   Em                     A
            Maaaaaad world 
Em                A
Enlarge your world 
Em       A
Mad world
