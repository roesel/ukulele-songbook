C       A7         Dm           G7          C      
  Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree,
    A7   Dm            G7           C
For me. (I've) been an awful good girl.
      A7       Dm             G7        C        A7 Dm G7
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.
C       A7      Dm            G7         C
  Santa baby, a fifty-four convertible too,
      A7    Dm           G7          C
Light blue,    I'll wait up for you dear.
      A7       Dm              G7        C        C7 
Santa baby, so hurry down the  chimney tonight.

[Chorus]

E7
Think of all the fun I've missed,
A
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed.
D
  Next year I could be just as good.
   G                  G7
If you'd check off my Christmas list.

[Verse]

C       A7      Dm              G7              C
  Santa baby, I wanna yacht and really that's not
  A7   Dm                G7          C
A lot,   (I've)  been an angel all year.
      A7       Dm             G7        C        A7 Dm G7
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.
C       A7     Dm                 G7            C
  Santa honey,   one little thing    I really need,
    A7    Dm     G7         C
The deed,   to a platinum mine.
      A7       Dm              G7       C        A7 Dm G7 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.
C       A7         Dm               G7       C
  Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with a Duplex
    A7       Dm           G7           C
And cheques.   Sign your 'X' on the  line.
      A7         Dm             G7        C        C7
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight.
 
[Chorus]

E7
Come and trim my christmas tree,
A
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's.
D
  I really do believe in you,
G                G7
Let's see if you believe in me.

[Verse]

C       A7       Dm             G7           C
  Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing,
  A7     Dm        G             C
A ring ,   I don't mean on the phone.
      A7       Dm             G7        C       A7
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.
Dm             G7        C        
Hurry down the chimney tonight.
Dm             G7        C        
Hurry down the chimney tonight.
