Title: One Day
By: Matisyahu

[Verse]
C            G             Am            F
 Sometimes I lay under the moon, I thank God I'm breathing
C       G                  Am                F
 Then I pray don't take me soon, 'cause I am here for reason

[Pre-Chorus]
C                       G
Sometimes in my tears I drown,
      Am                  F
but I never let it get me down
        C            G
So when negativity surrounds,
  Am                 F
I know someday it'll all turn around because

[Chorus]
C                     G
All my life I've been waiting for,
          Am                   F
I've been praying for, for the people to say
C                   G
That we don't wanna fight no more,
            Am                    F
there'll be no more wars, and our children will play
C        G        Am       F
One day, one day, one day,  oh oh oh
C        G        Am       F
One day, one day, one day,  oh oh oh

[Verse]
C          G           Am
 It's not about win or lose,
          F
'cause we all lose when they feed on the
C                      G
Souls of the innocent, blood-drenched pavement,
Am                        F
keep on movin' though the waters stay ragin'
C        G                        Am        F
 In this maze you could lose your way, your way
         C                    G                         Am      F
It might drive you crazy, but don't let it phase you no way, no way

[Pre-Chorus*]
Sometimes in my tears I drown...

[Chorus*]
All my life I've been waiting for...

[Verse]
    C                               G
One day this all will change, treat people the same,
Am                     F
stop with the violence, down with the hate
    C                      G
One day we'll all be free, and proud to be
Am                 F
under the same sun singing songs of freedom like

[Verse]
C      G     Am       F
Wye oh   Wye oh oh oh
C      G     Am       F
Wye oh    Wye oh oh oh

[Chorus*]
All my life I've been waiting for...
