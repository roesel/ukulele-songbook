[Verse]

C                           D
So, so you think you can tell
              Am
Heaven from Hell
                   G
Blue Skies from pain
                       D
Can you tell a green field
                    C
From a cold steel rail
                Am
A smile from a veil
                       G
Do you think you can tell
                       C
Did they get you to trade
                   D
Your heroes for ghosts
                  Am
Hot Ashes for trees
              G
Hot air for a cool breeze
                    D
Cold comfort for change
              C
Did you exchange?
                      Am
A walk on part in the war
                      G
For a lead role in a cage


[Solo*]

Em G Em G Em A Em A G


[Chorus]

C                                D
How I wish, how I wish you were here
            Am                                      G
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
                      D
Year after year.
                                  C
Running over the same old ground.
                                  Am
What have we found the same old fears
                G
Wish you were here...
