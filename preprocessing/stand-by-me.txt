[Verse]
     G          G
When the night, has come
Em              Em
and the land is dark
         C           D        G             D
and the moon, is the only, light we'll see
      G         G
no I won't, be afraid
      Em        G
no I won't, be afraid
        C             D              G    G
just as long, as you stand, stand by me


[Chorus]
     G       D        G
So, darling, darling, stand, by me
     Em       Em
oh, stand, by me
     C       D          G            G
oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me


[Verse]
        G        G
If the sky, that we look upon
Em                Em
should tumble and fall
        C                 D       G        D
or the mountains, should crumble, to the sea
     G         G
I won't cry, I won't cry
      Em         Em
no I won't, shed a tear
         C            D              G
just as long, as you stand, stand by me


[Chorus]
     G       D      C
So, darling, darling, stand, by me
     Em       Em
oh, stand, by me
     C       D          G
oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me


[Chorus]
      G        D     C
So, darling, darling, stand, by me
     Em       Em
oh, stand, by me
     C       D          G
oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me
