G            D/F#
As he begins to raise his voice
Em              D/F#                  G
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
                 D/F#
Drive until you lose the road
Em                         D/F#
Or break with the ones you've followed
G             D/F#
He will do one of two things
Em                D/F#
He will admit to everything
G                     D/F#
Or he'll say he's just not the same
 Em             D/F#
And you'll begin to wonder why you came
